# helloworld

This is a test page for me to try Github Pages. If I like it, I'll use Github to create a website for my kids' school so they can better organize academic information, such as class homework, for students and parents. The organized content will be easier to find on the website as opposed to emails. Information that parents fill out on a regular basis, such as fun food friday forms, will also be much easier to fill online as opposed to paper forms.
